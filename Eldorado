"  Gaily bedight,\n  A gallant knight,\nIn sunshine and in shadow,\n  Had journeyed long,\n  Singing a song,\nIn search of Eldorado.\n  But he grew old--\n  This knight so bold--\nAnd o'er his heart a shadow\n  Fell as he found\n  No spot of ground\nThat looked like Eldorado.\n\nAnd, as his strength\n  Failed him at length,\nHe met a pilgrim shadow--\n  \"Shadow,\" said he,\n  \"Where can it be--\nThis land of Eldorado?\"\n\n  \"Over the Mountains\n  Of the Moon,\nDown the Valley of the Shadow,\n  Ride, boldly ride,\"\n  The shade replied,\n\"If you seek for Eldorado!\""
