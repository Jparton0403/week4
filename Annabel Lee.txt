"It was many and many a year ago,\n  In a kingdom by the sea,\nThat a maiden there lived whom you may know\n  By the name of ANNABEL LEE;\nAnd this maiden she lived with no other thought\n  Than to love and be loved by me.\n\n_I_ was a child and _she_ was a child,\n  In this kingdom by the sea:\nBut we loved with a love that was more than love--\n  I and my ANNABEL LEE;\nWith a love that the winged seraphs of heaven\n  Coveted her and me.\n\nAnd this was the reason that, long ago,\n  In this kingdom by the sea,\nA wind blew out of a cloud, chilling\n  My beautiful ANNABEL LEE;\nSo that her highborn kinsmen came\n  And bore her away from me,\nTo shut her up in a sepulchre\n  In this kingdom by the sea.\n\nThe angels, not half so happy in heaven,\n  Went envying her and me--\nYes!--that was the reason (as all men know,\n  In this kingdom by the sea)\nThat the wind came out of the cloud by night,\n  Chilling and killing my ANNABEL LEE.\n\nBut our love it was stronger by far than the love\n  Of those who were older than we--\n  Of many far wiser than we--\nAnd neither the angels in heaven above,\n  Nor the demons down under the sea,\nCan ever dissever my soul from the soul\n  Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE.\n\nFor the moon never beams without bringing me dreams\n  Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE;\nAnd the stars never rise but I see the bright eyes\n  Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE;\nAnd so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side\nOf my darling, my darling, my life and my bride,\n  In her sepulchre there by the sea--\n  In her tomb by the side of the sea."
